tdd-jasmine-beancounter-example
===============================

A Jasmine TDD example.  Look at the branches for the progression from one behavior, to 2, then to refactored passing tests all the way.

master - Initial Version with basic functionality.

final-before-refactor-version - We now handle surplus messages correctly.

final-version - Refactored for cleanliness, de-duplication, and readability.
